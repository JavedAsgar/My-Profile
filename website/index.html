                <h4>Interest in IT</h4>
                <p>My interest in IT began a few years into my job as an Adminitration Officer. I saw how much of the administrative tasks were being rapidly computerized. Knowledge of software suites like Microsoft Office and programs like MYOB and SAP became a requirment in most of the roles in administration. I am looking to specialise in Robotics and Automation. One person that has inspired me towards this field is Elon Musk. </p>
                <p>I have experience using the Windows Operating System, Microsoft Office, apps on Android and internet browsing. RMIT is a reputable higher education provider and is ranked in the world's top 100 universities for computer science and information systems. I hope to gain a sound understanding of programming and software development by undertaking IT studies at RMIT.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
                <p>I believe that my ideal job in the IT industry is a Business Analyst. This role entails working with management and stakeholders in defining business requirements and creating effective solutions. I have good analytical and problem solving skills so these type of roles are quite suitable for me. Jobs as a Business Analyst usually requires the candidate to possess 5 years of experience or more in a similar role, a high level of communication and analytical skills and a degree or higher level qualification in business or technology. I hope to get started as an Intern or junior Analyst with an IT degree from RMIT. I will develop my skills and knowledge in these roles for about 5 years and then look to progress into a more senior role as an Analyst. I would also consider postgraduate study in Business to enhance my profile. <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50110562?type=standard#searchRequestToken=f763962d-28ff-47bb-926e-927176eaf613" target="_blank">Click to view an example of the job description for the role</a></p>

                <h4>Personal Profile</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Myers-Briggs test</strong> - 16personalities.com identifies me as a Protagonist personality type (ENFJ). Protagonists, according to 16personalities.com, are idealistic, visionary, inspirational and charismatic. However, idealism and altruism can become a hindrance in certain areas. Thus, conscious effort must be made to develop weaker traits and acquire additional skills. I feel the result is about 75% accurate. I will use my strengths to inspire my team and overcome challenging obstacles in our projects. I will also actively work on my weaknesses and develop my skills further. When forming a team, I would consider a good mix of personality types to leverage their specific strengths.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>online learning style test</strong> - Personality Max identified my learning style using the VAK model. This model categorizes sensory methods of learning as Visual (V),  Auditory (A) and Kinesthetic (K) learning styles. My results were 37% Visual, 34% Auditory and 24% Kinesthetic. I could contribute more in visual and auditory tasks in a team environment whilst seeking assistance from other members with kinesthetic activities. When forming a team, I would look to have people with high values in the kinesthetic learning style.  </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Big Five Personality test</strong> - truity.com measured my scores based on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN). My results were  92% Openness, 85% Conscientiousness, 85% Extraversion, 52% Agreeableness, and 31% Neuroticism. I could use my higher levels of openness, concientiousness and extraversion in team environments to stimulate new ideas and strategies. I could also use my personality to attract ideal members to my team.</li>

                <h3>Barista X</h3>
                <p>Man meets machine. Barista X creates a symbiotic relationship between a barista and a programmed robotic arm to deliver the best tasting coffee ever made. They work in sync with an automated coffee machine and and a self-service kiosk to optimise the coffee making process. All these machines will be connected using a customised software system with built-in analytics tools. Everything will be enclosed in a customised housing structure called "The Pod", which will be no bigger than a medium sized SUV.</p>
                <p>Everything is moving towards automation and AI so why should coffee making be left behind. Cafe and coffee shop industry in Australia has a market size of $8 billion. By providing a higher quality product (same taste every time), at a lower price and ideal location (small size and easy installation), Barista X will significantly disrupt this industry. We are talking billions. Built-in analytics and monitoring software will also help in reducing the carbon footprint by optimizing water and electricity use.</p>
                <p>This is how it works. Customer arrives at the self-service kiosk, puts his order in and pays using EFTPOS. As soon as the ayment is processed, the kiosk sends request to the robotic arm to place the coffee cup in position and coffee machine to start making the order. Then, the coffee machine sends query to the robotic arm to pick and place the filled cup infront of the barista. While this process was taking place, the barista was frothing milk, using a commercial frother, for the order. When the filled cup arrives infront of the barista, he used the prepared milk to complete the coffee making process adding latte art and toppings as required. She places the coffee infront of the customer who is waiting at the pick up counter. Sugar, stirrers and serviettes are situated at this counter for customer use. The baristas work on a four hour rotating roster and can easily churn out 180 cups of coffee per hour per barista. Production can be increased during high demand and in busy areas. The most important part of making good coffee is maintaining pour time of espresso at 25-30 seconds. This is achieved in conventional machines by the barista checking and adjusting the coffee grinder every 30 minutes. This is impossible to achieve during peak times hence a coffee connoisseur can easily tell the difference from one cup of coffee to the next from the same place. A programmable, automated coffee machine used in the Barita X system has self adjusting grinders which monitor the brewing flow automatically adjusting the grind and dose for consistent espresso quality. Hang on, isn't this just a glorified vending machine? No, <a href="https://cafexapp.com
                    " target="_blank">this is what a glorified vending machine looks like!</a> Cafe X is a competitor backed by Peter Theil, venture capitalist and part of the Paypal mafia. They have raised over $15 million USD since 2016 and let's just say progress is quite slow. So what's the difference you ask? Simple, it's the barista. He is what makes barista made coffee. He adds touches like cafe art, chocholate and fudge toppings and controls the amount and temperature of milk to take the espresso to the next level. Plus, coffee customers are not yet ready to let go of human servers. That is what makes the difference and that is why Barista X is a billion dollar idea.</p>
                <p>There are five major components of this project. A certified and experienced barista, programmable robotic arm, automated coffee machine, self-service kiosk (point of sale) and a software system that interacts with all other components. Requirements for these components would vary depending on coffee production size except for the software system, which will be built using python language and include data analytics functionality. Minor work like electrical, plumbing and pod design are also involved.</p> 
                <p>For Barista X's production, it will require skills like design, manufacture and installation for both hardware and software. This is quite easy to procure. For maintenance, contracts would be established with mechatronic engineering firms. For consumables, coffee specialist suppliers would be used. Baristas would operate and maintain the Barista X pods on a 4 hour rotating roster. As the enterprise grows, centralised offices will be established to manage operations.</p>     
                <p>One of Barista X's aim is to be the first coffee shop on Mars. This hints at Barista X' technology centric approach. This will allow it to be agile and adaptive to changes in the future. Barista X is set to disrupt the coffee shop and cafe industry in  a massive way. This will be achieved by providing a high quality barista made coffee in under 45 seconds. 25-30% cheaper than an average cup of coffee from a cafe and systems designed to have much lower carbon footprint than a conventional cafe or coffee shop. In 10 years, Barita X can have a 1000 pods operational across the globe with each pod raking in atleast $500k of revenue per year. You do the math!</p>
